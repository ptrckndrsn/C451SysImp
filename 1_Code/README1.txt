Inventory Management App Implementation Project

This app is designed to help control inventory and keep track of critical business information for 
an organization such as Customers, Products, Categories, Users and Orders. This application will keep track of 
all the information listed previously and hold that information in a database, mySQL specifically, that is connected to
the application. The front end of the application is in Java, and uses Java Swing for interface design. To run this code 
as it is today NEtBeans IDE will be needed. 

Once the project is imported into the NetBeans IDE, expand the project and right click on the file titled Splash.java and click Run File

This will open in Java and load and take the user to the Home Page where the app can be navigated from.
